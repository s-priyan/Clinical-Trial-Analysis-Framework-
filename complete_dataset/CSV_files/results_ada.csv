204d5293-d6e5-452a-8961-3b76d6be35c9,"  Arm/Group Description: Participants received immediate breast reconstruction using a sub-muscular tissue expander (TE) and acellular dermal matrix (ADM) sling placed during the same surgery. This was followed by post-mastectomy radiation therapy (PMRT) no sooner than a minimum of 6 weeks and optimally 6 months, if adjuvant chemotherapy was required. The prescribed chest-wall dose was 50 -50.4 gray (Gy) in 25-28 fractions given once daily over 5-7 weeks with a 0.5-centimeter (cm) bolus to the scar every other day. Permanent reconstruction was performed at least 5 months after completion of PMRT.",1,1

4e5a04a1-2513-472b-b2a7-891d68a3b549,  GFS was measured by microarray analysis of the entire 101 gene signature expression. The GFS is quantified as the change in gene expression between two separate samples collected from the same participant. A log (base 10) ratio of expression in the post-dose sample was generated relative to the reference in both the Up and DOWN arms of the gene signature. A log ratio value of zero indicated no change in the expression between the two samples. GFS was calculated as the mean log ratio of genes in the UP arm minus mean log ratio of genes in the Down arm. GFS was compared for paired samples (pre-dose and post-dose) by a T-statistic calculated as the GFS divided by its standard error. Responders to therapy had a T-statistic that was smaller than the threshold 1st percentile of student's T-distribution and were counted as having a decrease in GFS.,1,1

Performance speed is measured for Detection/Identification/Monitoring and performance accuracy is measured for Memory/Learning/ISLT/ISLT-Delayed Recall. Performance speed calculated as mean of the log10 transformed reaction time for correct responses (lower score=better); performance accuracy calculated as arcsine transformation of the proportion of correct responses (higher scores=better). Main outcome measure is a composite score (average of task scores after transformation and standardization by age-specific norms). A positive standardized score indicates that a patient performed better than average; a negative standardized score indicates below average results.

Performance speed is measured for Detection/Identification/Monitoring and performance accuracy is measured for Memory/Learning/ISLT/ISLT-Delayed Recall. Performance speed calculated as mean of the log10 transformed reaction time for correct responses (lower score=better); performance accuracy calculated as arcsine transformation of the proportion of correct responses (higher scores=better). Main outcome measure is a composite score (average of task scores after transformation and standardization by age-specific norms). A positive standardized score indicates that a patient performed better than average; a negative standardized score indicates below average results.

523d79a3-ee67-4b2a-a1cb-20ed4ed45dc6,  GFS was measured by microarray analysis of the entire 101 gene signature expression. The GFS is quantified as the change in gene expression between two separate samples collected from the same participant. A log (base 10) ratio of expression in the post-dose sample was generated relative to the reference in both the Up and DOWN arms of the gene signature. A log ratio value of zero indicated no change in the expression between the two samples. GFS was calculated as the mean log ratio of genes in the UP arm minus mean log ratio of genes in the Down arm. GFS was compared for paired samples (pre-dose and post-dose) by a T-statistic calculated as the GFS divided by its standard error. Responders to therapy had a T-statistic that was smaller than the threshold 1st percentile of student's T-distribution and were counted as having a decrease in GFS.,1,1

e04edb9d-dc0e-44c4-abb9-3260b400e265,"  The primary outcome is severity of the most bothersome vaginal symptom: dryness or dyspareunia. The Vaginal Symptom Measure (VSM) was used to evaluate the severity of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. The VSM uses a 5- point ordinal response scale; 1=""none"", 2=""mild"", 3=""moderate"", 4=""severe"" and 5=""very severe"" to measure the severity associated with vaginal dryness and/or dyspareunia. For each patient, the change in severity was calculated by subtracting the baseline from the week 12 reported score. Therefore, the full range of scores ranges from -4 (greatest decrease in severity) to 4 (greatest increase in severity). A negative score indicates a decrease in severity from baseline, zero indicates no reported affect and positive scores indicate a more severe report at week 12. The primary assessment method will be a comparison of the averages of the changes over time in the severity items for the most bothersome symptom from baseline to 12 weeks (as indicated at baseline).",1,0

1defe036-8290-4a01-bec7-f75305d1e88e,"  The primary outcome is severity of the most bothersome vaginal symptom: dryness or dyspareunia. The Vaginal Symptom Measure (VSM) was used to evaluate the severity of vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. The VSM uses a 5- point ordinal response scale; 1=""none"", 2=""mild"", 3=""moderate"", 4=""severe"" and 5=""very severe"" to measure the severity associated with vaginal dryness and/or dyspareunia. For each patient, the change in severity was calculated by subtracting the baseline from the week 12 reported score. Therefore, the full range of scores ranges from -4 (greatest decrease in severity) to 4 (greatest increase in severity). A negative score indicates a decrease in severity from baseline, zero indicates no reported affect and positive scores indicate a more severe report at week 12. The primary assessment method will be a comparison of the averages of the changes over time in the severity items for the most bothersome symptom from baseline to 12 weeks (as indicated at baseline).",0,0

6f0571f4-e1da-4732-9bdf-8c07bea059c1,  The intra-patient difference in hot flash activity between baseline (study week 1) and treatment termination (study week 7) is the primary endpoint. The hot flash activity will be measured by the weekly average hot flash score which is a composite entity of both frequency and severity of hot flashes.,1,0
6f0571f4-e1da-4732-9bdf-8c07bea059c1,"  The hot flash severities are graded from 1 to 4, ranging from mild, to moderate, to severe to very severe. The daily hot flash score is computed by multiplying the mean grade of severity by the frequency during every 24 hour period. Therefore, a score of zero is the lowest possible score and can be interpreted as having no hot flashes.

52b055fd-9e0d-41ad-9eb7-1a724cbc0112,  The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate non-inferiority of the Siemens' processing algorithm to Lorad's processing algorithm with regards to readers' diagnostic accuracy in detecting and characterizing breast lesions. The non-inferiority analyses were performed by comparing the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the two algorithms & to compare false positive marks per subject.,1,0

It shows in a graphical way the trade-off between clinical sensitivity and specificity for every possible cut-off for a test, and gives an idea about the benefit of using the test in question. The higher the total area under the curve, the greater the predictive power of the reader assessments.",0,0
